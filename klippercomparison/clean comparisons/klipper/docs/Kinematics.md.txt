 In the above, the frequent changes from acceleration to deceleration

 Specifically, the code calculates what the velocity of each move would
 be if it were limited to this virtual "acceleration to deceleration"
-rate (half the normal acceleration rate by default). In the above
-picture the dashed gray lines represent this virtual acceleration rate
-for the first move. If a move can not reach its full cruising speed
-using this virtual acceleration rate then its top speed is reduced to
-the maximum speed it could obtain at this virtual acceleration

+For most moves the limit will be at or above the move's existing
 limits and no change in behavior is induced. For short zigzag moves,
 however, this limit reduces the top speed. Note that it does not
 change the actual acceleration within the move - the move continues to

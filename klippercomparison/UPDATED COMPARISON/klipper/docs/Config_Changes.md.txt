 ## Changes
 
+20240912: `SET_PIN`, `SET_SERVO`, `SET_FAN_SPEED`, `M106`, and `M107`
+commands are now collated. Previously, if many updates to the same
+object were issued faster than the minimum scheduling time (typically
+100ms) then actual updates could be queued far into the future. Now if
+many updates are issued in rapid succession then it is possible that
+only the latest request will be applied. If the previous behavior is
+requried then consider adding explicit `G4` delay commands between
+updates.
+
+20240912: Support for `maximum_mcu_duration` and `static_value`
+parameters in `[output_pin]` config sections have been removed. These
+options have been deprecated since 20240123.
+
+20240415: The `on_error_gcode` parameter in the `[virtual_sdcard]`
+config section now has a default. If this parameter is not specified
+it now defaults to `TURN_OFF_HEATERS`. If the previous behavior is
+desired (take no default action on an error during a virtual_sdcard
+print) then define `on_error_gcode` with an empty value.
+
+20240313: The `max_accel_to_decel` parameter in the `[printer]` config
+section has been deprecated. The `ACCEL_TO_DECEL` parameter of the
+`SET_VELOCITY_LIMIT` command has been deprecated. The
+`printer.toolhead.max_accel_to_decel` status has been removed. Use the
+[minimum_cruise_ratio parameter](./Config_Reference.md#printer)
+instead. The deprecated features will be removed in the near future,
+and using them in the interim may result in subtly different behavior.
+
+20240215: Several deprecated features have been removed. Using "NTC
+100K beta 3950" as a thermistor name has been removed (deprecated on
+20211110). The `SYNC_STEPPER_TO_EXTRUDER` and
+`SET_EXTRUDER_STEP_DISTANCE` commands have been removed, and the
+extruder `shared_heater` config option has been removed (deprecated on
+20220210). The bed_mesh `relative_reference_index` option has been
+removed (deprecated on 20230619).
+
+20240123: The output_pin SET_PIN CYCLE_TIME parameter has been
+removed. Use the new
+[pwm_cycle_time](Config_Reference.md#pwm_cycle_time) module if it is
+necessary to dynamically change a pwm pin's cycle time.
+
+20240123: The output_pin `maximum_mcu_duration` parameter is
+deprecated. Use a [pwm_tool config section](Config_Reference.md#pwm_tool)
+instead. The option will be removed in the near future.
+
+20240123: The output_pin `static_value` parameter is deprecated.
+Replace with `value` and `shutdown_value` parameters.  The option will
+be removed in the near future.
+
+20231216: The `[hall_filament_width_sensor]` is changed to trigger filament runout
+when the thickness of the filament exceeds `max_diameter`. The maximum diameter
+defaults to `default_nominal_filament_diameter + max_difference`. See
+[[hall_filament_width_sensor] configuration
+reference](./Config_Reference.md#hall_filament_width_sensor) for more details.
+
+20231207: Several undocumented config parameters in the `[printer]`
+config section have been removed (the buffer_time_low,
+buffer_time_high, buffer_time_start, and move_flush_time parameters).
+
+20231110: Klipper v0.12.0 released.
+
 20230826: If `safe_distance` is set or calculated to be 0 in `[dual_carriage]`,
 the carriages proximity checks will be disabled as per documentation. A user
 may wish to configure `safe_distance` explicitly to prevent accidental crashes
